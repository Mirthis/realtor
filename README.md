# Cryptoverse

This app was built as part of me learning Javascript and React.

It's a fictional real estate site that allows to browse property for sale or for rent.

There's no back-end code for this app as all the required data are pulled from an API.

A deployed version of the app can be found [here](https://realtor-zeta-three.vercel.app/).
